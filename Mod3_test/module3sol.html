                <p>
                    <b> Chicken meat </b> contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
                    Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). 
                    The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
                
                <br>    <b>Chicken Breast: 284 Calories</b>
Chicken breast is one of the most popular cuts of chicken. It’s high in protein and low in fat, making it an excellent choice for people trying to lose weight.

<br> One skinless, boneless, cooked chicken breast (172 grams) has the following nutrition breakdown (1):

<br>Calories: 284<br>
Protein: 53.4 grams<br>
Carbs: 0 grams<br>
Fat: 6.2 grams<br>
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of chicken breast provides 165 calories, 31 grams of protein and 3.6 grams of fat (1).

That means that approximately 80% of the calories in chicken breast come from protein, and 20% come from fat.

Keep in mind that these amounts refer to a plain chicken breast with no added ingredients. Once you start cooking it in oil or adding marinades or sauces, you increase the total calories, carbs and fat.

                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.

                    Thankfully sushi is not a particularly fattening food, and a low calorie meal is not out of the cards if you have a craving for sushi. While the rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, sushi can be eaten without rice (as sashimi) and in moderation, even a standard sushi item can be a healthy treat without breaking the calorie bank. In this section we highlight the the calories in sushi and the nutritional values for common sushi items you will likely find in your sushi dining adventures. We have collected information on nigiri sushi (finger sushi), maki sushi (rolls), sashimi, side items you may find at a Japanese restaurant, and even items that are commonly found at grocery stores like Whole Foods.
