                <p>
                    <b> Chicken meat </b> contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
                    Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). 
                    The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
